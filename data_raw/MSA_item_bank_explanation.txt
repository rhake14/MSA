target_instrument 	= the target instrument that needs to be detected within the mixture
level			= the ammount of dB attenuantion of the target instrument compared to the mixture
complexity		= the number of instruments within the mixture
with_target_in_mix 	= specifies wheather the target was presented in the mixture (yes) or not (no)
song_nr			= song number wthin the "Medley" Database, see also "Song
song_name 		= name of the song that was used for the excerpt / item
time_song 		= starting point within the song_name
item_nr			= to identify the item
set_nr			= to ifentify the seed in which the item was constructed
answer			= which anwser would be correct
correct			= same as answer
condition		= the overall true difficulty of the respective condition 
			(based on with target in mix: 4 (level) * 2(complexity) * 4(target_instrument) 
			+ without target in mix 2(complexity) * 4(target_instrument) = 40 conditions
condition_theoretical   = the theoretical difficulty based on assumptions from the literature
practice_item		= yes means item is used for the training session
discrimination		= parameter based on the Bayesian IRT (mixed effects) model
guessing		= parameter based on the Bayesian IRT (mixed effects) model
inattention		= parameter based on the Bayesian IRT (mixed effects) model
difficulty		= parameter based on the Bayesian IRT (mixed effects) model
item_difficulty		= same as "difficulty"
condition_difficulty	= see condition
number_of_datapoints_per_cond 	= number of datapoints per condition that were used for the IRT model
number_of_datapoints_per_item	= number of datapoints per item that were used for the IRT model
used_in_160er		= item was used in the calibration experiment among the sample that used 160 items 
used_in_32er		= item was used in the calibration experiment among the sample that used 32 items 
used_in_package		= could be used in the package
flagged_item		= the IRT flagged the item as inappropriate
long_version_available	= long version of the stimuli is available (for CI and hearing aid user)
TimeStartHz		= beginning of the excerpt within the original full song mixture (sampling rate of 44100)
TimeEndHz		= ending of the excerpt within the original full song mixture (sampling rate of 44100)
TimeStartSec		= same as TimeStartHz but in seconds
TimeEndSec		= same as TimeEndtHz but in seconds
InsLead			= Lead-vocals were included in the mixture
InsGuitar		= Guitar(s) were included in the mixture
etc.

original_item_nr	= original item number (used for construction)
etc.
audio_file 		= name of the audiofile that is stored on the "DOTS"-Server (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Musikpsychologie)
item_number 		= similiar to "audio_file" but without ".wav"
long_audio_file 	= name of the audiofile of the long version (see description page of the MSA)
