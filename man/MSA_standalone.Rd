\arguments{
\item{title}{(Scalar character) Title to display during testing.}

\item{num_items}{(Scalar integer) Number of items to be administered. We recommend to use at least 30 items (default)
for the adaptive MSA and at least 40 for the non-adaptive version.}

\item{adaptive}{(Scalar boolean) Indicates whether you want to use the adaptive MSA (TRUE)
or the non-adaptive MSA (FASLE). Default is adaptive = TRUE.}

\item{long_version}{(Scalar boolean) Indicates whether you want to use the musical excerpts that include 8 seconds of music prior to the task (TRUE):
If (TRUE), each trail has the following procedure:
Part 1: the initial music segment (8s);
Part 2: after 1s pause, a single instrument (lead voice, bass, guitar, or piano) plays;
Part 3: after 1s pause, a mix of instruments plays, possibly including the target instrument.
If (FALSE), Part 1 is skipped (the original version; Default).}

\item{balance_over}{(Character vector) Indicates how items are selected from the item pool. Balance means that the proportion of items for each parameter is equal.
Please note that this option is only available for the non-adaptive Version of the MSA (adaptive = FALSE).
"target_instrument": the target instrument; balancing = equal proportion of the four different instruments ('Lead Voice', 'Piano', 'Guitar', 'Bass').
"complexity": the musical complexity, i.e. number of instruments within the mixture; balancing = equal proportion of items with 'three' and 'six' instruments.
"level": the level-ratio between target and the mixture; balancing = equal proportion of items with '0', '-5', '-10', '-15' level-ratios.
Default is a fully balanced design: c("target_instrument", "complexity", "level").
Note: By default, there is always an equal proportion of "with target instrument" and "without target" items in the pool.}

\item{take_training}{(Scalar boolean) Enable practice session before the actual session. Defaults to TRUE}

\item{with_video}{(Scalar boolean) Includes a demonstrative video in addition to the default text description,
to be used as an explanation for the practice session (take_training needs to be TRUE). Defaults to TRUE
Note: Correct display depends on the playback device. We recommend the use of Google Chrome.}

\item{with_picture}{(Scalar boolean) Includes a demonstrative picture in addition to the default text description,
to be used as an explanation for the practice session (take_training needs to be TRUE). Defaults to FALSE
Note: Correct display depends on the playback device. We recommend the use of Google Chrome.}

\item{with_id}{(Scalar boolean) Indicates, if ID should be asked for. Defaults to TRUE}

\item{with_feedback}{(Scalar boolean) Indicates if performance feedback will be given at the end of the test. Defaults to  FALSE}

\item{with_welcome}{(Scalar boolean) Indicates, if a welcome page shall be displayed. Defaults to TRUE}

\item{location_stim}{(Scalar character) Specify the location of the stimuli.
Default is the location on the DOTS servers from the "Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Musikpsychologie "https://media.gold-msi.org/test_materials/MSAT".
To start the test locally (without internet connection), one have to download all stimuli from the provided drives:
Stimuli long version (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OI2Ii2C8yUGu8M9BzyV3HVEiKv1YFXLf?usp=sharing)
Stimuli short version (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cxPEOyAaipXFtWNEBaBOyFkImftlEOSz?usp=sharing)
Videos, which should belong into the same folder as the stimuli (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_za6FNNnXWREk6NRAewvXhQsn9IG3TY8?usp=sharing)
Then, create a local host server using e.g.,"servr" package (servr::httd("C://Users//PC NAME//Stimuli folder path")) and then provide the
new URL, e.g., location_stim = "http://127.0.0.1:4321".}

\item{admin_password}{(Scalar character) Password for accessing the admin panel.}

\item{researcher_email}{(Scalar character)
If not \code{NULL}, this researcher's email address is displayed
at the bottom of the screen so that online participants can ask for help.}

\item{languages}{(Character vector)
Determines the languages available to participants.
Possible languages include English (\code{"en"}), German (\code{"de"}); formal German (\code{"de"}), and French (\code{"fr"}).
The first language is selected by default}

\item{validate_id}{(Character scalar or closure) Function for validating IDs or string "auto" for default validation
which means ID should consist only of  alphanumeric characters.}

\item{dict}{The psychTestR dictionary used for internationalisation.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to \code{\link{MSA}()}.}

\description{
This function launches a standalone testing session for the MSA (for test batteries please use the "MSA()" function).
This can be used for data collection, either in the laboratory or online.
